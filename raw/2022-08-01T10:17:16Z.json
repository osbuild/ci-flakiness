Err is always an error.\nSo this call is basically asking whether error can be assigned to error.\nIf err != nil, this is always true, thus this check doesn't make any sense\nover a plain err != nil.\n\nGo 1.19 now checks this issue and if it's found, it refuses to compile the\ncode, see:\n\nhttps://go-review.googlesource.com/c/tools/+/339889\n\nThis commit changes usages of errors.As() to errors.Is(). The Is() method\ndoesn't check assignability but equality (the only different between Is()\nand a plain old == operator is that Is() also inspects the whole error chain).\n\nThis fixes the check because now, we are basically checking if err (or\nany other error in its chain) == pgx.ErrTxClosed which is exactly what we\nwant.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ondřej Budai \u003condrej@budai.cz\u003e\n","parent_ids":["93592dabc1355490c16d1b80a8a39d059a7429e9"],"stats":null,"status":null,"last_pipeline":null,"project_id":0,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/redhat/services/products/image-builder/ci/osbuild-composer/-/commit/9def5455708f7e247fe4103d47e00a7beb52169b"},"coverage":0,"allow_failure":false,"created_at":"2022-07-27T16:38:26.822Z","started_at":"2022-07-27T18:16:20.505Z","finished_at":"2022-07-27T18:23:44.701Z","duration":444.196391,"queued_duration":4605.814367,"artifacts_expire_at":null,"tag_list":["terraform/openstack"],"id":2778815283,"name":"OSTree: [rhos-01/rhel-8.6-ga-x86_64]","pipeline":{"id":598426821,"ref":"main","sha":"9def5455708f7e247fe4103d47e00a7beb52169b","status":"failed"},"ref":"main","artifacts":[{"file_type":"trace","filename":"job.log","size":16406,"file_format":""}],"artifacts_file":{"filename":"","size":0},"runner":{"id":14681010,"description":"terraform/openstack","active":true,"is_shared":false,"name":"gitlab-runner"},"stage":"test","status":"failed","tag":false,"web_url":"https://gitlab.com/redhat/services/products/image-builder/ci/osbuild-composer/-/jobs/2778815283","project":null,"user":{"id":11032269,"username":"imagebuilder-bot","email":"","name":"Image Builder Bot","state":"active","web_url":"https://gitlab.com/imagebuilder-bot","created_at":"2022-03-04T08:26:27.259Z","bio":"","location":"","public_email":"","skype":"","linkedin":"","twitter":"","website_url":"","organization":"","job_title":"","extern_uid":"","provider":"","theme_id":0,"last_activity_on":null,"color_scheme_id":0,"is_admin":false,"avatar_url":"https://gitlab.com/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/11032269/avatar.png","can_create_group":false,"can_create_project":false,"projects_limit":0,"current_sign_in_at":null,"current_sign_in_ip":null,"last_sign_in_at":null,"last_sign_in_ip":null,"confirmed_at":null,"two_factor_enabled":false,"note":"","identities":null,"external":false,"private_profile":false,"shared_runners_minutes_limit":0,"extra_shared_runners_minutes_limit":0,"using_license_seat":false,"custom_attributes":null}},{"commit":{"id":"74bf3aa3df5dfffd58fbe8085d84b10d20497851","short_id":"74bf3aa3","title":"test/diff-manifests: checkout repo to $head on exit","author_name":"Jakub Rusz","author_email":"jrusz@redhat.com","authored_date":"2022-07-26T14:42:45+02:00","committer_name":"Christian Kellner","committer_email":"christian@kellner.me","committed_date":"2022-07-26T17:08:32+02:00","created_at":"2022-07-26T17:08:32+02:00","message":"test/diff-manifests: checkout repo to $head on exit\n\nDuring the diff-manifests.sh test the source repository checkout is\nchanged to generate manifests from current main branch for comparion.
