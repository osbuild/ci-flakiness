options\n\nPreviously, the worker was determining the GCE image guest OS Features\non its own, based on the OS name. This caused problems, in case the\nosbuild-composer was of a newer version than the worker.\n\nExample:\nosbuild-composer contained support for c10s GCE image type and its\nimplementation also contained the proper guest OS Features list for it.\nHowever, when the worker got the osbuild job, it built it and tried to\nfetch the guest OS Features for the distro. Since its implementation was\ntoo old, it didn't contain the code that added the actual support for\nc10s GCE images and got no guest OS features list (which is the default\nfor unsupported distros). The image was successfully uploaded and\nshared, but it does not boot in GCP, because it does not know that it\nshould use UEFI to boot it.\n\nThis behavior could be considered a bug. The worker should be dumb. It\nshould not be making decisions about the image features, but instead it\nshould take them from the upload target options. And composer should be\nthe authoritative source of truth for this. Because otherwise, we\nbasically have two components that need to be updated in sync to add\nsupport for GCE images on a new distro.\n\nMove the GCE image guest OS features to the GCP upload target options.\nThe worker will just take what is specified there and use it when\nimporting the image to GCP. As a compatibility layer for the case when\nthe composer would be older than the worker (unlikely, but still),\nworker will try to determine the image guest OS features in case the\nlist in the upload target options is empty.\n\nExtend the GCP functional tests to check that the imported image has at\nleast some guest OS features set.\n\nSigned-off-by: Tomáš Hozza
